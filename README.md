# RouteTimetableAddOns
A repository containing any timetables under development for existing routes. The timetables are stored here before being reviewed and added to the existing projects on Railway Operation Simulator.

# Submitting a Timetable

When submitting a timetable please create a new folder within this repository for the map you are contributing to (if one does not already exist), please ensure the filename is OS friendly (no spaces/special characters) and in the form `routename_author`.
Within the directory create a new folder for your timetable of the form `day_time_season/month_year_yourusername` (see the example below). Not this name may of course vary depending on the scenario itself.

Your submission should include at minimum:
* A program timetable file
* A session for the timetable with all routes set
In addition, it is recommended to include:
* A true life timetable (if available and not overly complex! e.g. London Underground would have many timetables so this would be an example of when not to include!)
* A README giving the user instructions on how to operate the timetable.

# Example: Adding a Timetable to Chiltern Railways

* Create new folder within repository `ChilternRailways_Krizar`.
* Create folder for timetable `MonFri_0600_1200_2020_krizar`.
* Add files: `ChilternRailways_MonFri_0600_1200.ttb`, `ChilternRailways_MonFri_0600_1200.ttb` and `README`.
